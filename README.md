***Rare Disease Treatment Is Costlyâ€”Delayed Diagnosis Makes It Even Worse***

In this project, I aim to analyze the diagnosis delays for people with rare diseases in the US and its effects on increased costs on already so expensive medical costs.  

Findings suggest that diagnosis delays can take from 4-5 years, in some cases up to 17 years. Besides ineffective treatment, such cases lead to increased costs.
